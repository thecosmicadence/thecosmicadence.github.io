Hi there! I'm Mahiguhappriya, a Research Trainee at Vainu Bappu Observatory, Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Kavalur, Tamil Nadu.  

-I'm passionate about observational astronomy, outreach, and science communication.
-I completed my Bachelors and Masters in Physics from University of Delhi
-Ever since my college days I have been engaging myself in astronomy and scientific writing. Feel free to explore my previous blogs at [Medium](https://medium.com/@m-prakash02)

This website is my digital garden — a place to share insights, projects, and thoughts. I strongly believe that learning science is to spread science and my words attempt to do at least a teeny-tiny bit of it every time. I hope you have a great time over here!🌌

Cheers,
MGP
