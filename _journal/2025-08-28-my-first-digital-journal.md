This is a pleasant start to engaging with my website often. Earlier I wanted to make a website from scratch just like a batchmate of mine. I don't want to tag their website here because I myself had stalked it years ago. I respect their privacy. Since I couldn't afford to build a website, I decided to use the help of GitHub Pages. Although I published my first scientific blog months ago, I couldn't post any more frequently. Hence the introduction of my _Digital Journal_. Let me name it _Richard Parker_.
